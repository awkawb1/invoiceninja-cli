  # points at host port 80 - where nothing is listening - instead of the forwarded 8080, giving a

  # The qemu-vm module's defaults (1 core, 1024MB) are too tight for real interactive use: MySQL +

  # browser, not a lightweight renderer) running concurrently can exhaust 1GB fast, and this VM
  # boots with panic_on_oom - so it's not a graceful slowdown, the whole VM goes down. Confirmed by
  # reproducing a "logo upload hangs" report this way: at the 1024MB default, even a couple of
  # concurrent PDF-generation requests triggered `redis-server invoked oom-killer` and a kernel
  # panic. 2 cores / 2560MB comfortably handles 2 concurrent PDF generations alongside normal
  # traffic (verified: ~1.4GB still free afterward); a deliberate flood of many concurrent PDF
  # requests can still exhaust even this, since each is a full chromium instance - if that's a
  # concern for your deployment, consider capping `phpfpm.settings."pm.max_children"` below its
  # default of 8, or provisioning more RAM.
